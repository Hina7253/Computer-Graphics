## 🖥️ Introduction
**Computer Graphics** is a field of computer science that focuses on creating, manipulating, and displaying visual content using computers.  
It helps in generating real-world images, animations, and visual simulations to represent data and ideas.

---

## 🎯 Advantages of Interactive Graphics
- Makes understanding complex data easier through visualization.  
- Provides better user interaction in software systems.  
- Helps in simulation, modeling, and gaming.  
- Enhances presentation and creativity in education and design.

---

## 💡 Use of Computer Graphics
- **Entertainment:** Movies, video games, animation.  
- **Education:** Interactive learning materials and simulations.  
- **Engineering:** CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems.  
- **Medical:** Visualization of scans and 3D body models.  
- **Business:** Charts, graphs, and reports.

## 🧩 Graphics Classification of Application
Computer Graphics applications can be classified as:
1. **Interactive Graphics** – user can directly interact (e.g., drawing software).  
2. **Non-Interactive Graphics** – pre-defined images (e.g., slideshows).  
3. **2D Graphics** – works on flat surface (e.g., MS Paint).  
4. **3D Graphics** – provides depth and realism (e.g., AutoCAD, games).

## ⚙️ Development of Hardware and Software for Computer Graphics
### 🖲️ Hardware
- Input devices: Mouse, scanner, light pen, joystick  
- Output devices: Monitor, plotter, projector  
- Processing devices: GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

### 💽 Software
- Programming tools: OpenGL, DirectX  
- Design tools: Blender, AutoCAD, Adobe Illustrator  
- Libraries and APIs help to render shapes, colors, and effects.

## 🧠 Conceptual Framework for Interactive Graphics
An interactive graphics system includes:
1. **Input devices** → user provides data  
2. **CPU / Processing** → system processes data  
3. **Frame Buffer** → stores image data  
4. **Display Device** → shows the final image  

Flow:  
**User → Application Program → Graphics System → Display**

## 🔍 Overview of Scan Conversion
Scan conversion is the process of converting geometric data (lines, circles, etc.) into pixels on the screen.  
It includes:
- **Line Drawing:** DDA and Bresenham’s algorithm  
- **Circle Drawing:** Midpoint circle algorithm  
- **Ellipse Drawing:** Midpoint ellipse algorithm  

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Computer Graphics combines art and technology to represent information visually.  
It plays an important role in design, simulation, education, and entertainment.
